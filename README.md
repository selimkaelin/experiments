# Experiments

A collection of tiny projects just to try things out.

### `rust-cpp`

Trying out interoperability between Rust and C++ using the [cxx](https://cxx.rs/index.html) crate.
Interest initially sparked because the [s2geometry](https://github.com/google/s2geometry) package for geospatial operations is written in C++ and Rust bindings are not complete.
Use of s2geometry abandoned in favor of [h3](https://h3geo.org/).
